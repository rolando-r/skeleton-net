# .NET Core Skeleton Project

🚀 **Welcome to this .NET Core Skeleton Project, designed to provide you with a solid foundation when starting your applications.** In this repository, you'll find an initial and simplified structure that you can use as a starting point for various types of applications, from console applications to web services.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to offer you an initial and well-organized structure in which you can build your own applications in .NET Core. This template allows you to focus on the specific logic and functionality of your application, leveraging a modular and scalable architecture.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **Api:** This folder contains the entry point of your application, controllers, and routing configurations for web services.

- **Application:** This is where the logic of your application resides. Application services, DTO mappings, validations, and other application layer components are located in this folder.

- **Persistence:** In this folder, you will find the persistence layer, where you define database contexts, repositories, and migration configurations.

- **Domain:** Here, you define the fundamental entities and business rules for your application.

## 🛠 Skills
